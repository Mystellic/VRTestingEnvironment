# VRTestingEnvironment
This is an incredibly simple testenvironment made in for Virtual Reality

In order to install the apk in this repository on a Quest, or Quest 2 device, you can use the SideQuest app.

The following steps describe the installation process:
1) Go to https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto and download the ADVANCED INSTALLER, you will need its functionality
2) Install SideQuest from the setup.exe
3) Plug in your Quest or Quest 2 and use oculus link (if this is not yet set up, fetch a turorial on the internet, there are plenty)
4) Make sure your Oculus Quest 2 is set to the developer mode (If not, again fetch a tutorial of which there are hundreds)
5) Open the sidequest app, which should now identify your device, you can tell by the green circle in the left corner.
6) Press the install apk's button (yeah this is a thing, it's one right of the wifi icon in the top of the Sidequest application)
7) Select the APK and let sidequest do the magic
8) The apk should now be succesfully installed on your device, you can find it under the "Unkown Sources" tab in the apps menu
9) Done
10) If you still can't find the unknown sources thing, open the app menu's, look for where it says "All" (in the top right) and change this to "Unkown sources"

Good luck and have fun!
